AI Chess Project - Demystifying AI with MiniMax ğŸ¤–â™Ÿ

ğŸ‘‹ Welcome to our AI Chess Project for the course "Demystifying AI". In this project, we have implemented the MiniMax algorithm ğŸ§  to power the decision-making process of an AI chess player â™Ÿ.

The MiniMax algorithm is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss ğŸ“‰ for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain ğŸ“ˆ. In our project, we use this algorithm to simulate an intelligent opponent ğŸ‘¤ in the gameÂ ofÂ chessÂ â™Ÿ.
